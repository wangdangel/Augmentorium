## Overview
Augmentorium is a powerful, modular, and extensible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform designed for AI-driven code understanding, project analysis, and knowledge graph workflows. It seamlessly integrates code indexing, context-aware search, and advanced AI agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Augmentorium is built for:
- Codebase semantic search and RAG
- AI agent orchestration (Claude, Klein Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Knowledge graph generation and visualization
- Multi-project and multi-modal workflows

---

## Features
- ‚ö° **Fast, concurrent code indexing**
- üîé **Semantic search over code and docs**
- üß† **Knowledge graph construction**
- ü§ñ **MCP server for agent/LLM integration (Standard IO)**
- üåê **Web-based force-graph frontend**
- üîå **Pluggable project support**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Strict typing and error reporting**
- üì¶ **Easy deployment via Supervisor and one-line installers**
- ‚òï **[Support the developer!](https://buymeacoffee.com/ambientflare)**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for embeddings, must be installed locally)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/augmentorium.git
cd augmentorium_release
```

### 2. Run the Installer for Your Platform
### Platform Script Permissions & Privileges

> **IMPORTANT:**
> - **Windows:** You must run `setup_augmentorium_windows.bat` as **Administrator**. Right-click the script and select "Run as administrator" to ensure all dependencies and services are installed correctly.
> - **Linux & Mac:** You must run the setup script as **root** (use `sudo`). Before running, make sure the script is executable:
>   ```bash
>   chmod +x setup_augmentorium_linux.sh   # or setup_augmentorium_mac.sh
>   sudo ./setup_augmentorium_linux.sh     # or sudo ./setup_augmentorium_mac.sh
>   ```
> - If you downloaded the script or cloned the repo on Linux/Mac, always check permissions and use `chmod +x` if needed.

These scripts handle all dependency installation, environment setup, and Supervisor configuration. No manual Python environment setup is required.

Choose your platform and run the provided script:
- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  setup_augmentorium_windows.bat
  ```
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  bash setup_augmentorium_linux.sh
  ```
- **Mac:**
  ```bash
  bash setup_augmentorium_mac.sh
  ```

---

## Usage

All services (indexer, API server, MCP server, frontend) are automatically managed by Supervisor and the provided installer scripts. **You do not need to manually launch or configure any processes.**

- To start or restart Augmentorium, simply rerun the setup script for your platform.
- Supervisor ensures all components are running and automatically restarts them if needed.

---

## MCP Server Setup (Cline, Roo, Claude Coder, Windsurf, etc.)

The MCP server is implemented in Node.js and communicates via **standard IO** (stdin/stdout). This enables seamless integration with Cline, Roo, Claude Coder, Windsurf, and other MCP-compliant agents.

### How to Add Augmentorium to Your `mcp_config.json`

Add the following chunk to the `tools` section of your `mcp_config.json`:

```json
"augment": {
  "transports": [ "stdio" ],
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "c:path_to_install_folder/augmentorium/mcp/dist/mcp-server.js"
  ],
  "cwd": "c:path_to_install_folder/augmentorium/mcp",
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 60,
  "autoApprove": [],
  "alwaysAllow": []
}
```

> **Note:**
> - The above paths use Windows-style (`c:path_to_install_folder`). 

## Ollama Embedding Requirements

Augmentorium uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local embedding generation. **You must have Ollama installed locally** for embedding and semantic search features to work.

- Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)
- Once installed, embeddings will be available automatically to Augmentorium. No need to run a separate server.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The frontend force-graph fails to render or throws errors?**
- Ensure all backend graph data links reference existing nodes (see backend filtering logic).
- Rerun the setup script to ensure all services are running.

**Q: Embeddings are not working?**
- Make sure Ollama is installed locally.
- Rerun the installer if you encounter issues.

**Q: How do I restart all services?**
- Rerun the setup script for your platform.
